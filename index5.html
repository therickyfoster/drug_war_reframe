<p>Addiction thrives where meaning collapses—places marked by
poverty, isolation, unemployment, trauma and hopelessness.
Rural health experts note that low educational attainment,
poverty, lack of mental‑health care and isolation drive
substance use in rural communities【395601033660152†L86-L94】.
The National Academy of Medicine’s report on social
determinants of overdose explains that poverty, unemployment,
housing instability and structural racism contribute to
overdose crises and shape access to services【449638355935092†L26-L66】.
It recommends investing in housing, income supports,
decriminalisation and integrating harm‑reduction services with
wraparound social supports【449638355935092†L110-L130】.
Community‑driven harm‑reduction programmes embody this
approach: they reflect local values, build trust and have
reversed hundreds of overdoses.  In Lucas County, a
community‑led harm‑reduction initiative reduced overdose
deaths by 20 %【202207112024450†L160-L165】.  Reframing drug use as
a symptom of social stress shifts funding from enforcement to
community strength—conservatives hear “community resilience,”
progressives hear “social support,” and both agree.</p>
